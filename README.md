## Story

<h6>
The player takes on the role of a self-confident knight who has been ridiculed and doubted by the kingdom's people for his entire life. But one day, a wise witch tells him of a legendary treasure at the top of the Sky Tower that will magically make him the best knight in the kingdom. 

Determined to prove himself, the knight sets out to climb the tower, facing numerous challenges and dangers along the way. As he climbs, he discovers the tower's secrets and learns that it poses a great threat to the kingdom. 

But the knight is torn between his desire to claim the treasure and prove himself as the greatest knight in the kingdom, and his duty to protect the people. Ultimately, he realizes that he must make a difficult choice: to either claim the treasure and to seak revenge on those who doubted him, or to put his own desires aside and work to stop the tower's danger to the kingdom.
